Walcadia is a community driven fork of the popular arcadia wallet [Walcadia](https://github.com/arcadiacoin/walcadia) ðŸ’™

It's a fully client-side signing wallet for sending and receiving [arcadia](https://github.com/arcadiacoin/arcadia-node/) either directly in your browser at [wallet.arcadiacoin.net](https://wallet.arcadiacoin.net) or with the [desktop app](https://github.com/arcadiacoin/walcadia/releases/latest).

Seamless integration with any arcadia compatible RPC backend/websocket and the aim to be more frequently maintained are some of the main features. Those together will greatly increase the stability, performance and uptime.

## How To Use
Walcadia comes in different flavors to suit your need.
#### Desktop App
Available for Windows/Mac/Linux - just head over to the [latest release](https://github.com/arcadiacoin/walcadia/releases/latest) and download the version for your OS.

If you want to verify the binary checksum there are plenty of apps to do this. One way is using a powershell or bash terminal:

* **Powershell:** `Get-FileHash -Path '.\Walcadia-Setup-x.x.x-Windows.exe' -Algorithm SHA256`
* **Bash:** `openssl sha256 Walcadia-x.x.x-Linux.AppImage`

Then compare the output hash with the one listed in the corresponding checksums file that you download.

#### Web App
You can also use Walcadia from any device on the web at [walcadia.arcadiacoin.net](https://walcadia.arcadiacoin.net).

#### Mobile App
There is no native mobile app but the web wallet contains a Progressive Web App (PWA). That allows you to run it in offline mode for remote-signing.

If you visit [wallet.arcadiacoin.net](https://wallet.arcadiacoin.net) in your phone you will be given the option to install it.

* Android: Click on "Install walcadia for Android" in the menu
* iOS (Safari only): 1 - Tap the share button. 2 - Select "+ Add to home screen". 3 - Open Walcadia from the home screen
